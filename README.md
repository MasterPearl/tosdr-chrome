Chrome Extension which rates the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy of websites and services from a user rights perspective based on http://tos-dr.info.

“I have read and agree to the Terms” is the biggest lie on the web. We aim to fix that.
"Terms of Service; Didn't Read" is a user rights initiative to rate and label website terms & privacy policies,
from very good (Class A) to very bad (Class E).

This extension shows this rating for rated websites by an unintrusive icon in the address bar.
You can click on this icon to get a list with the most important rated points of the website's term of services.
Additional the extension will warn you when you visit for the first time a website with a bad rating.
